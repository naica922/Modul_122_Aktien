# DOCUMENTATION
## STOCK AUTOMATIZATION
#### made by Naima Cavegn, Zachary Jenkins <br><br>

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This repository is for an automation project of module 122 Bash. <br>
The assignment was as LB2 project work to create an automation with server and client, also taking security into account.<br>
Everyone in the team should have their own customized code, but ideas and inspirations can be shared. <br>
It's an automation for stocks that tracks the increase and decrease of the stocks and updates them in certain time intervals.<br>
Users can enter their e-mail and receive the data from the stocks accordingly.<br>
The automation is useful for those who are interested in the market and stocks, as they are directly notified when something happens. 
All data is retrieved from an API and updated at certain frequency, then stored in a database.<br>
Our project also takes security into consideration, which is why we have login details that can be found in the installation section.<br>

## MILESTONES
A: We discussed the Projekt with our teacher and filled out the document with the "An forderungsdefinition". In a second step we created an UML  activity diagram. <br>

<br>
B: Implementation of the solution <br>
C: We've created this GitHub Repository with three branches. One for Zachary, one for Naima and the main branch. However, we had a little trouble working with the branches because we haven't done this before. However, we tried our best.

## PROJECT START AND END:
We started the project approximately on the 26.03.24 and had to work on it at school a total of 4 times. <br>
That's about 16 hours in altogether and the rest at home. <br>
The project was presented on 6.5.24 with a demo and the documentation.

## PROJECT RESULTS:
Our project can send emails and checks the status of the API with the latest data.

## TEAM:
Naima Cavegn and Zachary Jenkins
We basically wrote our code on our own, but we were allowed to support each other with questions and project development.

## DEADLINE:
The project deadline was May 6, when we also had to hand in our project.

## INSTALLATION:
To use our project yourself, you can use the following instructions with the data and set up the project locally.<br>
We both created our own documentation for the setup which you can find in this markdown or in the branches.
