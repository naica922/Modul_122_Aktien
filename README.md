# DOCUMENTATION
## STOCK AUTOMATIZATION
#### by Naima Cavegn<br>

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION FOR USERS:
This repository is for an automation project of module 122 Bash. <br>
The assignment was as LB2 project work to create an automation with server and client, also taking security into the project.<br>
Everyone in the team should have their own customized code, but ideas and inspirations can be shared. <br>
It's an automation for stocks that tracks the values of the stocks and updates them in certain time intervals.<br>
Users can enter their e-mail and receive the data from the stocks accordingly.<br>
The automation is useful for those who are interested in the market and stocks, as they are directly notified when something happens. 
All data is retrieved from an API and updated at certain frequency.<br>
Our project also takes security into consideration, which is why we have login details that can be found in the code.<br>

## INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR ADMINS:
In order to use my project, I have created instructions for the corresponding setup and the development environment as described in the main branch.<br>

### 1. download Python<br>
To install the latest version of Python you can use the following link:
“https://www.python.org/?downloads”<br>
Once the setup has started, it is important that you specify to add Python to the system variables. <br>
Otherwise you may have problems later.<br>
You can test whether the download was successful in the terminal with the command “python --version”. <br>
It should show you which version you have and whether it exists at all. <br>

### 2. download development environment<br>
So that you can test the code, it is best if you get yourself a development environment. This could be VSCode, pyCharm etc.<br>
Choose the one that works best for you. Then create a new project there and add the code that is in this repository.<br>
It's best to name the file “stock_price_tracker.py”, because that's what I called mine and if you want it differently you have to modify the next steps.<br>

### 3. run project<br>
To test my project, open Windows Powershell or the CMD. Enter the following commands one after the other. <br>
cd “/your/location/stock_price_tracker.py” -> This command navigates to the corresponding directory, make sure that it has to be customized. <br>
python3 stock_price_tracker.py -> This command executes the code <br>
!If you get the error that the file could not be found then check for spelling mistakes and make sure that you go to the innermost folder otherwise the file will not be found!<br>
