### made by Naima Cavegn, Zachary Jenkins <br><br>

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This repository is for an automation project of module 122 Bash. <br>
The assignment was as LB2 project work to create an automation with server and client, also taking security into account.<br>
Everyone in the team should have their own customized code, but ideas and inspirations can be shared. <br>
It's an automation for stocks that tracks the increase and decrease of the stocks and updates them in certain time intervals.<br>
Users can enter their e-mail and receive the data from the stocks accordingly.<br>
The automation is useful for those who are interested in the market and stocks, as they are directly notified when something happens. 
All data is retrieved from an API and updated at certain frequency, then stored in a database.<br>
Our project also takes security into consideration, which is why we have login details that can be found in the installation section.<br>
